Before you can access Jenkins, there are a few quick "one-off" steps you'll need
to perform.

When you first access a new Jenkins controller, you are asked to unlock it using
an automatically-generated password.

After the 2 sets of asterisks appear in the terminal/command prompt window,
  browse to `http://localhost:8080` and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page
  appears.

Display the Jenkins console log with the command:
docker logs jenkins-blueocean

From your terminal/command prompt window again, copy the
  automatically-generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of
  asterisks).

On the *Unlock Jenkins* page, paste this password into the *Administrator
  password* field and click *Continue*.

After <<unlocking-jenkins,unlocking Jenkins>>, the *Customize Jenkins* page
appears.

On this page, click *Install suggested plugins*.

The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and the
suggested plugins being installed. This process may take a few minutes.

Finally, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.

When the *Create First Admin User* page appears, specify your details in the
  respective fields and click *Save and Finish*.
When the *Jenkins is ready* page appears, click *Start using Jenkins*. +
  *Notes:*
* This page may indicate *Jenkins is almost ready!* instead and if so, click
  *Restart*.
* If the page doesn't automatically refresh after a minute, use your web browser
  to refresh the page manually.
If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just
  created and you're ready to start using Jenkins!

Throughout the remainder of this tutorial, you can stop your
Docker container by running:

docker stop jenkins-blueocean jenkins-docker

To restart your Docker container:

Run the same `docker run ...` commands you ran for <<on-macos-and-linux,macOS, Linux>> or
  <<on-windows,Windows>> above. +
Browse to `http://localhost:8080`.
Wait until the log in page appears and log in.

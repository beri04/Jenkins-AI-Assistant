title: Add a Jenkinsfile


.Add a Jenkinsfile to the repository

If the plugin repository does not already include a Jenkinsfile, add a `Jenkinsfile` so that  will automatically compile and test the plugin and any pull requests submitted to the plugin.

// Create the branch

Create a file named `Jenkinsfile` with the content:

``` groovy
buildPlugin(
  useContainerAgent: true, // Set to `false` if you need to use Docker for containerized tests
  configurations: [
    [platform: 'linux', jdk: 21],
    [platform: 'windows', jdk: 17],
])
```
Be sure the configuration platform is set correctly.
Building with a `Jenkinsfile` configuration that includes Java 8 will result in a low-level class version error when using version 4.52 or later of the plugin parent POM.

// Create a pull request

A job will be automatically created in the  after the pull request is merged and the GitHub organization folder is scanned by ci.jenkins.io.

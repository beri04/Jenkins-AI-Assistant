title: Setup a Crowdin Project
layout: developersection


Crowdin is an agile translation tool, which provides a modern web interface to propose and review translations with ease, without the need of any prerequisites you normally need, when working with Jenkins views.

This guide aims to provide guidance for project maintainers, how to prepare and setup their project, in order to use crowdin.jenkins.io.
This guide is not needed for people, who want to translate plugins only and aren't plugin maintainers.
Refer to  if you want to learn more about using Crowdin as a translator.

Before integrating your project with Crowdin, you should have internationalized it.
Internationalization documentation for Jelly, Java and Groovy can be found .

To request the creation of a new project,
fill out a crowdin issue on the .

On GitHub, open the repository you want to integrate. Navigate to "Actions" -> "New workflow" and select "By Jenkins" -> "Crowdin integration" -> "Configure".

The default workflow requires one modification in order to work. +
Change `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID: #` to the actual project ID. You can find it in the URL if you edit the project settings on crowdin.jenkins.io, for example `https://jenkins.crowdin.com/u/projects/4/crowdsource`, in this case, the project ID is `4`. You can find your project ID in your helpdesk issue too, if your project has been created.

To let the GitHub action access the project, you need to create a personal access token (PAT) on  +
Give the PAT a name, select the scope "Projects" and "Create" the token. You may have to confirm your credentials again. Copy the token, it'll never be shown again. +
Return to your GitHub repository and select "Settings" -> "Security" -> "Secrets" -> "Actions" -> "New repository secret" in the upper right corner. For the name of the secret set `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`, for the value you insert the token you generated on crowdin.
Hit "Add secret" and you are done.

Create a `crowdin.yml` in the root directory of your plugin using the following setup:

files:
  - source: '/src/main/resources/path/to/your/translations/**/*.properties'
    ignore:
      - '/src/main/resources/path/to/your/translations/**/%file_name%_%two_letters_code%.properties'
      - '/src/main/resources/path/to/your/translations/**/%file_name%_%locale_with_underscore%.properties"'
    translation: '/src/main/resources/path/to/your/translations/**/%file_name%_%two_letters_code%.properties'
    escape_quotes: 0
    escape_special_characters: 0

project_id_env: CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID
api_token_env: CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN

Replace `/path/to/your/translations/` with the appropriate folder structure of your plugin, take a look at the  for a practice example. +
Leave the `_env` variables untouched.

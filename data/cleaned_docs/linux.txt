Jenkins installers are available for several Linux distributions.

* <<Debian/Ubuntu>>
* <<Fedora>>
* <<red-hat-centos,Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives>>

On Debian and Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu you can install Jenkins through `apt`.

You need to choose either the Jenkins Long Term Support release or the Jenkins weekly release.

[#debian-java]

Jenkins requires Java to run, yet not all Linux distributions include Java by default.
Additionally,  with Jenkins.

There are multiple Java implementations which you can use.
 is the most popular one at the moment, we will use it in this guide.

Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 21, and check the installation with the commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre
java -version

If the installation was successful, you should see an output similar to the following:

openjdk 21.0.8 2025-07-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.8+9-Debian-1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.8+9-Debian-1, mixed mode, sharing)

On Debian/Ubuntu, it is strongly recommended to install Java *before* Jenkins.
If Jenkins is installed first and Java is added later, the Jenkins service may fail to start with:

jenkins: failed to find a valid Java installation

Installing Java first ensures the environment is fully initialized and avoids this issue.
After completing the Java installation, continue with the Jenkins installation steps below.

[#debian-stable]

[#long-term-support-release]
A  is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period.
It can be installed from the .

sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins

[#debian-weekly]

[#weekly-release]
A new release is produced weekly to deliver bug fixes and features to users and plugin developers.
It can be installed from the .

sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins

Beginning with Jenkins 2.335 and Jenkins 2.332.1, the package is configured with `systemd` rather than the older System V `init`.
More information is available in .

The package installation will:

* Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. Run `systemctl cat jenkins` for more details.
* Create a '`jenkins`' user to run this service.
* Direct console log output to `systemd-journald`. Run `journalctl -u jenkins.service` if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
* Populate `/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service` with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g `JENKINS_HOME`
* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

If Jenkins fails to start because a port is in use,
run `systemctl edit jenkins` and add the following:

[Service]
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8081"

Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.

[TIP]

Why use `apt` and not `apt-get` or another command?
The apt command has been available since 2014.
It has a command structure that is similar to `apt-get` but was created to be a more pleasant experience for typical users.
Simple software management tasks like install, search and remove are easier with `apt`.

You can install Jenkins through `dnf`. You need to add the Jenkins repository from the Jenkins website to the package manager first.

[#long-term-support-release-2]
A  is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period.
It can be installed from the  yum repository.

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo dnf upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo dnf install fontconfig java-21-openjdk
sudo dnf install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

[#fedora-weekly]

[#weekly-release-2]
A new release is produced weekly to deliver bug fixes and features to users and plugin developers.
It can be installed from the  yum repository.

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo dnf upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo dnf install fontconfig java-21-openjdk
sudo dnf install jenkins

You can enable the Jenkins service to start at boot with the command:

sudo systemctl enable jenkins

You can start the Jenkins service with the command:

sudo systemctl start jenkins

You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

sudo systemctl status jenkins

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see an output like this:

Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Tue 2018-11-13 16:19:01 +03; 4min 57s ago

If you have a firewall installed, you must add Jenkins as an exception.
You must change `YOURPORT` in the script below to the port you want to use.
Port `8080` is the most common.

YOURPORT=8080
PERM="--permanent"
SERV="$PERM --service=jenkins"

firewall-cmd $PERM --new-service=jenkins
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-short="Jenkins ports"
firewall-cmd $SERV --set-description="Jenkins port exceptions"
firewall-cmd $SERV --add-port=$YOURPORT/tcp
firewall-cmd $PERM --add-service=jenkins
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

[#red-hat-centos]

You can install Jenkins through `yum` on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux, CentOS, and other Red Hat based distributions.

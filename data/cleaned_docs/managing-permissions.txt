This page documents managing permissions for plugin maintainers.
There are 2 main permissions available to plugin contributors:

* **GitHub permissions**.
  It includes merging pull requests, push to the repositories, managing GitHub applications, etc.
  The effective list of permissions depends on the , see below.
* **Release Permissions** which are needed to deploy releases to the .
  Snapshots can be deployed by contributors without this permission.

NOTE: If you want to adopt a plugin, please see  instead.

GitHub permissions in Jenkins are managed by GitHub teams.
Almost every plugin has a `<pluginId> Developers` team created specifically for this plugin.
This team may have a different  depending on time of creation.
For all new repositories we tend to grant `Admin` permissions at the moment, and other plugin teams can get permissions elevated upon a request.

Any active maintainer is eligible to add more contributors to the GitHub repository.
There are multiple ways to do that:

Via GitHub Web Interface, if you have admin permissions in the `<pluginId> Developers` team
** It is possible to also add collaborators to repositories
Via a request in the
Via a request in the
Via the ChatOps command in the `#jenkins` IRC channel, if you have voice permissions there (see the )

You will need to send a permission transfer request and to specify the permission recipient's GitHub account and Jenkins LDAP (aka Jenkins Jira) account there.
An explicit approval by an active maintainer will be required before the permission transfer happens.
If there no response from a maintainer, a  might be used to request ownership of the plugin.

There are two following ways to do that:

Via ChatOps command in the `#jenkins` IRC channel, if you have voice permissions there (see the )
Via a request in the .

The following approvals are generally recognized as valid:

* Confirmation in a Jenkins Jira ticket (permission request or other ticket)
* Explicit approval in a GitHub pull request or issue
** The reply should be sent from a GitHub account associated with a maintainer's Jenkins LDAP account
* Confirmation in the .
** The reply should be sent from the email listed in the Jenkins LDAP account

Other types of approval (emails from different addresses, email forwards by requesters, etc.) will be reviewed and verified by `jenkinsci` GitHub administrators.

Release Permissions are needed to deploy releases to the .
Permissions to upload plugin releases are independent of GitHub push access and maintained in the  repository.

To request upload permissions for a new maintainer:

If you have never done it before,
  you log in at least in once with your Jenkins account into the .
  Any modification to the permission files will be ineffective until then.
File a PR in the  for the specific plugin repository which needs the permission change.
  Refer to the  for more detailed instructions.
  Once the permissions are updated, you'll be able to release your plugin.

//TODO(oleg-nenashev): Add CoC violations and so on?

Permission removal can be requested in the same way, e.g. during .
Such requests are subject for explicit approval by contributors being removed or by `jenkinsci` GitHub administrators.

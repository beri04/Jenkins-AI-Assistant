title: Performing a Plugin Release manually
layout: developer


[IMPORTANT]
.Prefer automated releases instead of releasing manually

See  instead of this guide.

Make sure you have permissions to release the plugin.

You will need to tell Maven your credentials to access .
You can obtain your encrypted password from Artifactory using `curl`.

Use this command:

curl -u your_user_name:your_password https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/setup/settings.xml

This will print the configuration you need to your terminal. You should see something similar to this:

$ curl -u mr_jenkins:j3nkinsr0ck5 https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/setup/settings.xml
<settings xmlns="https://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>maven.jenkins-ci.org</id> // <1> <username>mr_jenkins</username>
      <password>APrj80t4398w8fnytd498nft4dt8so</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>

<1> This is not a valid host name anymore, but still the ID used by default in the Jenkins plugin parent POM.

Store the output as `~/.m2/settings.xml` (`~` representing your user home directory, e.g. `/home/yourname` or `C:\Users\yourname`), creating the file if it doesn't exist yet.
If you already have this file, merge the `server` block provided in the output with your existing `servers` section, if any, and otherwise add the provided `servers` section to your file.

Maven Release Plugin will automatically push to the repository when performing a release, so you need to .

See the  for more information.

Always test your SSH connection before performing a release:

ssh -T git@github.com

If you have been authenticated correctly, you see a message similar to the following example in your terminal:

```txt
Hi yourGitHubUsername! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

`yourGitHubUsername` is a placeholder representing your GitHub username.

With GitHub and Maven credentials set up, performing a release should be as easy as running the following command:

mvn release:prepare release:perform

// Not sure about this:
// NOTE: While it is be possible to specify the username and password on the command line, that would require your accounts on GitHub and the Jenkins community to match, and prevent you from using two factor authentication on GitHub.
// Neither is a recommend practice.

First, make sure your plugin uses a reasonably up to date .
This will prevent the vast majority of problems in releasing the plugin, such as outdated Maven plugins, or obsolete host names.

Unauthorized means that your credentials were invalid, or not sent by Maven.

Make sure you've updated your encrypted password since the last time you changed your password on .

The two most common explanations for this error:

* You don't have permission to upload to the specified path.
  .
  Check that the path you're allowed to upload to matches the actual upload attempt (i.e. no typos).
* The specified release already exists and you try to overwrite it.
  We do not allow replacing existing releases.
  Specify a different, previously unused version number during the release process.

If none of the provided solutions help, send an email to the  and explain what you did, and how it failed.

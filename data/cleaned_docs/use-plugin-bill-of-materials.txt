Updating the versions of plugin dependencies manually can be exhausting, looking for the correct set of versions that work with each other and do not cause upper-bounds dependency error reports.
The  simplifies that by shifting the evaluation of versions from each plugin author to a centralized process maintained by members of the Jenkins community.

// Create the branch

Add a `dependencyManagement` section to the `dependencies` section of the pom file that references the  of the plugin bill of materials for that line.
For example, the addition might look like:

<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.jenkins.tools.bom</groupId>
      <artifactId>bom-2.504.x</artifactId>
      <version>5701.va_b_018a_a_6b_0d3</version>
      <scope>import</scope>
      <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

Remove as many `<version>` declarations from the pom file as you can while still compiling successfully.

// Compile the plugin

Confirm that there are no errors reported and no test failures reported.

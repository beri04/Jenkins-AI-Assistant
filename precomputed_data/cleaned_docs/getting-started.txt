section: doc


This guided tour introduces you to the basics of using Jenkins and its main
feature, Jenkins Pipeline. This tour uses the "standalone" Jenkins distribution,
which runs locally on your own machine.

For this tour, you will require:

* A machine with:
** 256 MB of RAM, although more than 2 GB is recommended
** 10 GB of drive space (for Jenkins and your Docker image)
* The following software installed:
** Java 17 or 21
** https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] (navigate to https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[*Get Docker*] site to access the Docker download that's suitable for your platform)

Open up a terminal in the download directory
Run `java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080`
Browse to `http://localhost:8080`
Follow the instructions to complete the installation

When the installation is complete, you can start putting Jenkins to work!

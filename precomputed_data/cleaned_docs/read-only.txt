title: Read only view
layout: developer


Extended read and system read permission allow read only access
to parts of Jenkins.

The jelly taglib's in core will render a read only look and feel,
if the user only has access to read the view.

This is handled for developers transparently if they are already using one
of the supported views, like the `job` configure view.

There are 3 permissions currently that interact with read-only views:

* Overall/SystemRead
* Agent/ExtendedRead
* Job/ExtendedRead

They are currently not enabled by default, the easiest way to enable them is to install
the plugin:extended-read-permission[Extended read permission plugin] v3.2 or above.

Jelly example:

<!-- configure permissions on a job required for write access -->
<j:set var="readOnlyMode" value="${!it.hasPermission(it.CONFIGURE)}" />

<!-- administrator permissions required for write access -->
<j:set var="readOnlyMode" value="${!app.hasPermission(app.ADMINISTER)}" />

Groovy example:

// configure permissions on a job required for write access
set("readOnlyMode", !it.hasPermission(it.CONFIGURE))

// administrator permissions required for write access
set("readOnlyMode", !app.hasPermission(app.ADMINISTER))

It's also possible to only use read-only mode for part of a view,

This is an example taken from the /configure page showing the
`SYSTEM_READ` and `MANAGE` permissions working together, non-editable parts of the view
render in a read only manner:

<j:forEach var="descriptor" items="${h.getSortedDescriptorsForGlobalConfigUnclassifiedReadable()}">
    <j:set var="editable" value="${h.getSortedDescriptorsForGlobalConfigUnclassified()}"/>
    <j:set var="readOnlyMode" value="${!editable.contains(descriptor)}" />
  <!-- (unnecessary context removed) -->
  <st:include page="${descriptor.globalConfigPage}" from="${descriptor}" />
  <!-- (unnecessary context removed) -->
</j:forEach>

If you provide your own taglib that isn't in Jenkins core you may need to make some changes.

Depending on what change is required there are a few different changes you might need to make,
here are a few examples.

We also add a default text when it is empty (N/A in this case):

<j:choose>
    <j:when test="${readOnlyMode}">
        <j:choose>
            <j:when test="${empty(value)}">
                <span class="jenkins-not-applicable">N/A</span>
            </j:when>
            <j:otherwise><pre class="jenkins-readonly">${value}</pre></j:otherwise>
        </j:choose>
    </j:when>
    <j:otherwise>
    ... your normal default configuration
    </j:otherwise>
</j:choose>

It is preferable to render plain text or some other method that is obvious to the user
what is going on (disabled controls aren't very obvious), but a lot of the javascript
and jelly taglibs depend on inputs of specific types being there for rendering,
so sometimes it is preferable to just disable the control:

<input type="radio"
    checked="${attrs.checked?'true':null}"
    disabled="${readOnlyMode?'true':null}"
/>

Like an X button on a repeatable element:

<j:if test="${!readOnlyMode}">
    <f:block>
    <div align="right">
        <f:repeatableDeleteButton value="${attrs.deleteCaption}" />
    </div>
    </f:block>
</j:if>

Normally in Jenkins the layout tag of a page will have a permission
attribute which governs which permission is required to access the page.

Jenkins has a concept of 'impliedBy' in it's permission, which means that each permission is allowed to be automatically granted by another one.
_Job/ExtendedRead_ is implied by _Job/Configure_, which means that requiring _Job/ExtendedRead_
to access a view, will also grant _Job/Configure_ access.

Here are some examples that show what you will need to update the layout tag to:

Requiring the _Job/ExtendedRead_ permission in Jelly:

<l:layout permission="${it.EXTENDED_READ}">
...
</l:layout>

_Overall/SystemRead_ Jelly:

<l:layout permission="${app.SYSTEM_READ}">
...
</l:layout>

_Overall/SystemRead_ Groovy:

l.layout(permission: app.SYSTEM_READ) {
...
}

Often it makes sense to remove parts of a view, such as 'Save' or 'Apply' buttons.

For system read the simplest way to do this is to use the `l:isAdmin` tag:

_isAdmin_ Jelly:

<l:isAdmin>

</l:isAdmin>

_isAdmin_ Groovy:

l.isAdmin() {
...
}

There's also a `l:hasAdministerOrManage` tag that can be used to check for the `Jenkins/Administer or `Jenkins/Manage` permissions.

If those don't fit, then you can write your own permission check:

_hasPermission_ Jelly:

<j:if test="${it.hasPermission(it.CONFIGURE)">

</j:if>

_hasPermission_ Groovy:

if (!it.hasPermission(it.CONFIGURE)) {
...
}

Firstly you will need to update any server side permission checks to now check
on load for the _Read_ permission, rather than the _Configure_  or _Administer_ permission.
See  for more information
on this feature.

i.e.

public Object getTarget() {
    checkPermission(Jenkins.SYSTEM_READ);
}

Then you will need to review if additional permission checks are required,
i.e. any methods that allow saving or sensitive data access should now require the
permission that was previously in use.

Searching for 'public .* do' is a good start as web methods normally start with 'do', but
you should carefully review to make sure nothing is now exposed that shouldn't be.

public void doInstallPlugin() {
    checkPermission(Jenkins.ADMINISTER);
}

You do not need to worry about bumping your minimum required Jenkins core version
as this feature is driven by variables set in the jelly context,
old versions of Jenkins will just ignore it.

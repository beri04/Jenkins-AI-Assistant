title: Command Palette


Jenkins now features a new search experience known as *Command Palette*.
Located in the upper-right corner of the page next to your name, the Command Palette enables you to search everything in Jenkins.

For example, enter "git #23 console" to display the results for the console output page of "git job build #23".
The Command Palette feature utilizes auto-completion to help you find what you're looking for.
Results can include additional search terms for narrowing results, Pipelines, Views, additional features installed within your Jenkins environment, such as the Design Library, and specific pages within jobs based on your installed plugins, such as the plugin:warnings-ng[Warnings] plugin.
Search results also provide more clarity in the form of icons to help indicate Jenkins features and job statuses.

The Command Palette is also accessible via keyboard commands for macOS (`CMD+k`) and Windows/Linux (`CTRL+K`).

Please note that case-insensitive search is not available for anonymous (not signed in) users.

[[SearchBox-OpenSearchsupport]]

This search feature is also exposed to the browser through http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch[OpenSearch], so you can install this search and auto-completion feature in your browser search box, making it even easier to navigate Jenkins.

For example in Firefox, you can add the Jenkins search to your browser's search engines via the dropdown on the right of the address bar:

There's always room for improvement in how Jenkins associates search terms with actual pages.

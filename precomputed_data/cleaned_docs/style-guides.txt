NOTE: Not all existing plugins may follow these rules, as those were established or enforced later.

A plugin's artifact ID is used as the file base name and to uniquely identify the plugin in Jenkins and on update sites.
It needs to follow some conventions to be published:

* Use a lowercase ID, and separate terms with hyphens as needed.
* Include neither `jenkins` or `plugin` in the ID unless necessary for the name to make any sense at all.

For example, use `snapchat-notification` instead of `JenkinsSnapchatNotificationPlugin` or `notification-plugin-for-snapchat`.

The ID cannot be changed after the first release; Jenkins would consider it a different plugin.

A plugin's name is shown to users on the Jenkins UI and elsewhere, such as the plugin site.
If is recommended to use a short and descriptive name, like _Subversion_.

Including _Jenkins_ or _Plugin_ in the name to indicate that it is a plugin for Jenkins is redundant and discouraged, and these terms may be stripped from the name in some cases to ensure consistency in lists, and to shorten the name.

All new hosting requests are instructed to use `io.jenkins.plugins` as group ID. +
We do not strictly prohibit other group IDs unless they're in bad faith (e.g. referencing an organization you have no relationship with), but we strongly recommend using `io.jenkins.plugins` to avoid confusion and use a standardized pattern.

The Jenkins project generally follows the  but it's not well enforced even in core components.
Individual plugin maintainers sometimes choose to use different style guides for their plugins.

Git commit messages should start with a reference to the Jira issue they're related to, if applicable, followed by a short summary on the first line, and more details on subsequent lines.
Example:

[JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget

If a given commit _fixes_ the specified issue, use of one of the following prefixes will make an automated infra process resolve the related Jira issue.

[FIX JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget
[FIXED JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget
[FIXES JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget

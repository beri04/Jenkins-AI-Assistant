Jenkins Symbols are an extensive and consistent collection of icons for use in Jenkins and plugins.
Symbols are intended to be used everywhere a traditional icon would be used, such as in the sidebar,
in buttons and in tables. Symbols are scalable, support different weights and adapt to the user's theme.

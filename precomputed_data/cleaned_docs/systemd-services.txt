Beginning with Jenkins 2.332.1 and Jenkins 2.335, the Linux package installers use `systemd` to manage services.
The RPM and deb package installers migrate configuration settings from System V `init` to `systemd` overrides.

The current service configuration of the Jenkins service as configured by the package installers and any overrides can be viewed with:

systemctl cat jenkins
# /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service
#
# This file is managed by systemd(1). Do NOT edit this file manually!
# To override these settings, run:
#
#     systemctl edit jenkins
#
# For more information about drop-in files, see:
#
#     https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html
#

[Unit]
Description=Jenkins Continuous Integration Server
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
NotifyAccess=main
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jenkins
Restart=on-failure
SuccessExitStatus=143

# /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true"

When installed on a modern Linux distribution running `systemd(1)`, the `systemd(1)`  is delivered to:

Debian:: `/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service`
Red Hat:: `/usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service`
openSUSE:: `/usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service`

The main service unit is read-only and not intended to be edited manually.
It contains a large notice at the top of the file reminding the user that it is read-only.

Values may be overridden in the drop-in unit (`override.conf` file) for the service.
Edit the drop-in unit with:

# systemctl edit jenkins

The `override.conf` file is stored at `/etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d/override.conf` and can be used to customize the service.
Note that such customizations must be done in a `[Service]` section in order to take effect.
Example content of the `override.conf` file might include:

[Unit]
Description=My Company Jenkins Controller

[Service]
# Add JVM configuration options
Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true -XX:+UseStringDeduplication"

# Arbitrary additional arguments to pass to Jenkins.
# Full option list: java -jar jenkins.war --help
Environment="JENKINS_OPTS=--prefix=/jenkins --javaHome=/opt/jdk-21"

# Configuration as code directory
Environment="CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG=/var/lib/jenkins/configuration-as-code/"

WARNING: `systemctl edit jenkins` creates the drop-in unit as `root` with 0644 (`-rw-r--r--`) permissions.
The migration logic, on the other hand, creates the drop-in unit as `root` with 0600 (`-rw---`) permissions.
This might be of consequence if you store an HTTPS keystore location and/or password in the drop-in unit
and also run jobs directly on the controller,
a practice which the Jenkins project .
When in doubt, secure the drop-in unit by setting its permissions to 0600 with `chmod(1)`.

The drop-in unit unifies configuration across all three distributions: Debian, Red Hat, and openSUSE.
Also note that the drop-in unit is not overwritten on upgrades.

NOTE: Unlike the System V `init(8)` configuration, the `override.conf` file only contains customizations, not the original defaults.
Users who are accustomed to editing an existing set of defaults must refer to the (read-only) service unit side-by-side when editing the drop-in unit
or use a command like `systemctl edit jenkins --full`, which copies the original service unit instead of creating a drop-in unit.

Editing the drop-in unit with `systemctl edit jenkins` will automatically reload the `systemd(1)` configuration.
The settings will take effect the next time Jenkins is restarted.
If you edit the drop-in unit without `systemctl(1)`, you need to run `systemctl daemon-reload` for the changes to take effect.

A final point to mention about the service unit is its use of specifiers,
which may be unfamiliar to some users.
The drop-in unit does not perform shell expansion.
Specifiers can insert contextual information (like system hostname, unit name, and operating system kernel release) into the drop-in unit.
The `systemd(1)` documentation contains .

Once the Jenkins `systemd` service has been defined, it can be started with:

# systemctl start jenkins

If Jenkins does not signal startup completion within a configured time,
the service will be considered failed and will be shut down again.
As each initialization milestone (i.e., "Started initialization", "Listed all plugins",
"Prepared all plugins", "Started all plugins", "Augmented all extensions",
"System config loaded", "System config adapted", "Loaded all jobs",
"Configuration for all jobs updated", and "Completed initialization") is attained,
the timeout is extended by the value of the `jenkins.model.Jenkins.extendTimeoutSeconds` system property (by default, 15 seconds).
The timeout can be configured with the `TimeoutStartSec` directive in the service unit.

The Jenkins `systemd` service can be stopped with:

# systemctl stop jenkins

The Jenkins `systemd` service can be restarted with:

# systemctl restart jenkins

After changes to configuration files, the service definition may need to be reloaded with:

# systemctl daemon-reload

Logs for the Jenkins service can be read with the command:

journalctl -u jenkins

Log files retained by `systemd` are commonly configured to automatically rotate.
If the log files need to be reduced in size, use the command:

journalctl --vacuum-size=500M

The Jenkins `systemd` service status can be viewed with `systemctl status jenkins`.
Some examples are shown below.

After upgrading plugins:

systemctl status jenkins
● jenkins.service - Jenkins Continuous Integration Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d
             └─override.conf
     Active: active (running) […]
   Main PID: […] (java)
     Status: "Restart in 10 seconds"

As Jenkins is being brought down:

systemctl status jenkins
● jenkins.service - Jenkins Continuous Integration Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d
             └─override.conf
     Active: deactivating (stop-sigterm) since […]
   Main PID: […] (java)
     Status: "Stopping Jenkins"

As Jenkins is starting up:

systemctl status jenkins
● jenkins.service - Jenkins Continuous Integration Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d
             └─override.conf
     Active: activating (start) since […]
   Main PID: […] (java)

After successful startup:

systemctl status jenkins
● jenkins.service - Jenkins Continuous Integration Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d
             └─override.conf
     Active: active (running) since […]
   Main PID: […] (java)

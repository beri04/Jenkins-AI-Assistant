The Jenkins architecture is designed for distributed build environments.
It allows us to use different environments for each build project balancing
the workload among multiple agents running jobs in parallel.

The Jenkins controller is the original node in the Jenkins installation.
The Jenkins controller administers the Jenkins agents and orchestrates their work, including scheduling jobs on agents and monitoring agents.
Agents may be connected to the Jenkins controller using either local or cloud computers.

The agents require a Java installation and a network connection to the Jenkins controller.
View the 3 minute video below for a brief explanation of Jenkins agents.

.What is a Jenkins Agent

Jenkins agents provide executors that perform work when requested by the Jenkins controller.
Agents can run Pipeline steps, freestyle jobs, and other jobs.

Specific capabilities of agents are often noted by assigning labels to the agents.
An agent running on an Arm64 computer might be assigned the `aarch64` label so that jobs can limit themselves to only run on agents with the Arm64 processor.
An agent running with a code signing application might be assigned the `code-signing` label so that jobs that need to sign executables would run there.

Agents may be allowed to run any job or they may be restricted to only run jobs that are specifically assigned to the agent.

The number of executors determines how many concurrent tasks can be run on an agent.
For Jenkins controllers, it is recommended to set this to `0` to avoid resource contention.
Executors should be configured on agents (nodes) instead.

*Why set executors to 0 on the controller?*
Setting executors to `0` ensures that the controller is dedicated to managing builds and coordinating agents, rather than executing builds itself.
This improves stability and performance.

For instance, agents with specific capabilities can be configured with multiple executors to handle concurrent builds effectively.

Labels are used to group agents (nodes) based on specific criteria.
They help in assigning jobs to specific agents.
For example, you can label agents based on their operating system or hardware capabilities.

Example:

linux, windows, docker, high-memory

Labels can be assigned in the agent configuration settings.

This section defines how jobs are assigned to agents.
Options include:

* **Use this node as much as possible**: Jobs will be assigned to this node whenever possible.
* **Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node**: Jobs will only be assigned if their label matches.

Jenkins agents can be launched in physical machines, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and with Docker images.
This section connects Docker agents to Jenkins with SSH.

To run this guide you will need a machine with:

* Java installation
* Jenkins installation
* Docker installation
* SSH key pair

If you need help to install Java, Jenkins and Docker please visit the section

To generate the SSH key pair, you have to execute a command line tool named `ssh-keygen` on a machine you have access to. It could be:

 * the machine on which your Jenkins controller runs
 * the host (if using containers)
 * a machine on which you have an agent running
 * or even your developer machine

The SSH key pair generation can be done on any operating system:

* On Windows, you can use any OpenSSH installation such as https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse[Windows OpenSSH], the `ssh-keygen` that is included with https://gitforwindows.org/[git for Windows], or https://cygwin.com/[Cygwin]
 * On Unix (Linux, macOS, BSD, etc.) you can use any OpenSSH installation packaged with your system as well

TIP: Note that you will have to be able to copy the key value to your controller and agent afterwards, so check that you can copy a file content into the clipboard beforehand.

1. In a terminal window run the command: `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key`
2. Provide a passphrase to use with the key (it can be empty)
3. Confirm the output looks something like this:
ubuntu@desktop:~$ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key
Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:XqxxjqsLlvDD0ZHm9Y2iR7zC6IbsUlMEHo3ffy8TzGs
The key's randomart image is:
---[RSA 3072]+
|  o+             |
| ...o  .         |
|  .o .+ .        |
|    o+.+ o o     |
|  ... o.So* .    |
|  o+ = +.X=      |
| o oO + *..+     |
|. oo.o o .E .    |
| o... oo.. o     |
[SHA256]-+

From your Jenkins dashboard, navigate to *Manage Jenkins*.
In the Security section, select *Credentials*.
Under *Stores scoped to Jenkins*, select `Add Credentials` from the global option.
Fill in the following information, as shown in the example, substituting your information as needed:
* Kind: SSH username with private key
* ID: jenkins
* Description: The Jenkins SSH key
* Username: jenkins
* Private Key: Select *Enter directly* and then select *Add* to insert the content of your private key file (`~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key`).
* Passphrase: Enter the passphrase used to generate the SSH key pair (or leave it empty if you didn't use one in the previous step).
Select *Create* to complete your credential configuration.

Here we will use the  to create the agent containers.

1. run the command to start your first agent:
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 -p 22:22 \
-e "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=<your_public_key>" \
jenkins/ssh-agent:alpine-jdk21

* Remember to replace the tag <your_public_key> for your own SSH *public* key.
* Your public key value in this example could be found by issuing : `cat ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key.pub` on the machine your created it. Do not add the square brackets `[]` around the key value
* The value of [your-public-key] MUST include the full contents of your .pub file, including the `ssh-XXXX` prefix.
** Ex: `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAAQQCo9+BpMRYQ/dL3DS2CyJxRF+j6ctbT3/Qp84+KeFhnii7NT7fELilKUSnxS30WAvQCCo2yU1orfgqr41mM70MB`
* [[ssh-anchor]] If your machine already has a ssh server running on the `22` port (if you logged onto this machine thanks to the `ssh` command, that's the case), you should use another port for the `docker` command, such as `-p 4444:22`

2. Now the container `agent1` is running. +
Hint: the command `docker ps` can be used to check if the container is running as expected.

Here we will use the  to create the agent containers.

1. run the command to start your first agent:
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 --network jenkins -p 22:22 `
  -e "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=<your_public_key>" `
  jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk21

* Remember to replace the tag <your_public_key> for your own SSH *public* key.
* Your public key in this example is: `Get-Content $Env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\jenkins_agent_key.pub`

2. Now the container `agent1` is running. +
Hint: the command `docker ps` can be used to check if the container is running as expected.
Additionally, the command `docker container inspect agent1 | Select-String -Pattern '"IPAddress": "\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+"'` can be used to see the *Host* to be set in Jenkins for the agent.

From your Jenkins dashboard, navigate to *Manage Jenkins*.
Select *Nodes*.
Select *New Node* to create your agent.
Enter your Node name, select the Permanent Agent option, and select *Create*.
On the agent creation page fill in the fields:
* Remote root directory
* Labels
* Usage
* Launch method
** Host
** Credentials
** Host Key verification Strategy
Select *Save* and `agent1` will be registered, but offline for the time being.
Select the `agent1` node to view its status.

The status page should show the message: `This node is being launched.`
If that's not the case, select *Relaunch agent* and wait a few seconds.

After waiting, select the `Log` option to view the logs.
At the bottom of the log, you should receive the message: `Agent successfully connected and online`.

If your Jenkins controller does not start the agent via ssh, please check the port you <<ssh-anchor,configured>> on your agent.
Copy the port number and then select *Advanced*.
Under *Advanced*, you can paste the port number into the *Port* field.

From your Jenkins dashboard select *New Item*.
Enter a name, for example, `First job on agent1`.
Select *Freestyle project* and select OK to create the job.
Select the option *Restrict where this project can be run*.
Enter the node label (`agent1`) in the *Label Expression* field.
Be careful with white spaces before or after the label.

Select the *Execute shell* option from the *Build Steps* dropdown;
Add the command: `echo $NODE_NAME` in the *Command* field and the name of the agent will be printed inside the log when this job is run.
Select *Save* and then select *Build Now*.
Wait a few seconds, and then go to *Console Output* page.
You should receive output similar to:

# Runtime Data

This directory contains preprocessed data required by the application at runtime.

- This is **not training data**
- This is **not the full Jenkins documentation**
- Data here is generated during ingestion and used by the RAG pipeline
- Included to ensure deterministic startup and reliable demos

In a production system, this data would be generated dynamically or stored externally.

title: Add a contributing guide


If the plugin does not already include a contributing guide and if it would benefit from more detail than is provided in the , add a contributing guide so that others understand how to help with plugin development.
Look for existing contributing instructions in files like `README.md`.
Move the content from the `README.md` file to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file so that the README file stays focused on user documentation.

// Create the branch

The contributing guide often includes instructions to:

* Compile and run automated tests
* Run the plugin in a development environment
* Report code coverage of the plugin and its tests
* Report static analysis results

Refer to the contributing guides of other plugins for common examples, like:

title: Report an Issue


The plugins site  includes a “Report an Issue” link for each of the plugins.
The linked page guides the user to provide a better classified issue and leads them to the correct path to privately report security issues.

// Create the branch

Add a heading in the plugin documentation that links to the specific “Report an Issue” link provided by the  site.
Some plugins use GitHub issues.
The link from the  site is the correct link to use in that case as well.

For example, the link for the git plugin is , while the link for the elastic axis plugin is .

diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

index 41fad51..e4bc674 100644
--- a/README.md
++ b/README.md

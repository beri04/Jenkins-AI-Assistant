Most Jenkins configuration changes can be made through the Jenkins user interface or through the plugin:configuration-as-code[configuration as code plugin].
There are some configuration values that can only be modified while Jenkins is starting.
This section describes those settings and how you can use them.

Jenkins initialization can also be controlled by run time parameters passed as arguments.
Command line arguments can adjust networking, security, monitoring, and other settings.

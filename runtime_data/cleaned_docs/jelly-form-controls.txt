This tag creates a right-aligned button for performing server-side validation. It is suitable for situations where the validation depends on the values of multiple input fields, such as credential check that uses both username and password.

<f:entry title="${%Access Key ID}">
  <f:textbox field="accessId" />
</f:entry>
<f:entry title="${%Secret Access Key}">
  <f:password field="secretKey" />
</f:entry>
<f:validateButton
   title="${%Test Connection}" progress="${%Testing...}"
   method="testConnection" with="secretKey,accessId" />

The `title` attribute is used to determine the text written on the button. The `progress` attribute determines the message displayed while the server-side validation is in progress. The `method` attribute specifies the server-side method invoked by this button; this follows the stapler name mangling convention, so for example `method="testConnection"` will invoke the `doTestConnection` method. This method needs to be on the Descriptor class that owns this form fragment.

The `with` attribute specifies the input fields sent to the server for the validation. They are matched against the `field` attribute or the `name` attribute of other input controls. The values of the nearest input fields above the `<f:validateButton/>` are sent to the server, so this means the button has to come after the input fields. Multiple fields can be specified by using ','.

On the server side, this tag invokes the standard "do"-style method like this:

@POST
public FormValidation doTestConnection(@QueryParameter("accessId") final String accessId,
        @QueryParameter("secretKey") final String secretKey,
        @AncestorInPath Job job) throws IOException, ServletException {
    try {
         if (job == null) {
             Jenkins.get().checkPermission(Jenkins.ADMINISTER);
         } else {
             job.checkPermission(Item.CONFIGURE);
         }
        ... do some tests ...
        return FormValidation.ok("Success");
    } catch (EC2Exception e) {
        return FormValidation.error("Client error : "+e.getMessage());
    }
}

The `doTestConnection` method contains the validation logic. In the end, this method has to call either `FormValidation.ok`, `.warning`, or `.error` method. Depending on which method you use, the appropriate HTML will be rendered on the client side to indicate the status to the user.

Expandable section that shows "advanced..." button by default. Upon clicking it, a section unfolds.

<f:section title="Advanced Project Options">
  <f:advanced>
    <st:include page="configure-advanced.jelly" />
  </f:advanced>
</f:section>

Foldable block expanded when the menu item is checked.

<f:block>
  <table>
    <f:optionalBlock name="dynamic" title="Use existing dynamic view">
      <f:entry title="View drive">
        <f:textbox name="drive" value="${it.drive}"/>
      </f:entry>
    </f:optionalBlock>
  </table>
</f:block>

Unchecked the text box will not be displayed
Checked the text box is displayed

Use an  tag to enclose the normal select tag.

<f:entry name="goalType" title="Choose Goal Type" field="goalType">
    <select name="goalType">
        <option value="buildGoal">Build Goal</option>
        <option value="spotBugsGoal">SpotBugs goal</option>
    </select>
</f:entry>

Basically the same as above. You need to define the following method in the descriptor of your Describable instance:

public ListBoxModel doFillGoalTypeItems() {
    ListBoxModel items = new ListBoxModel();

    items.add("Build Goal", "buildGoal");
    items.add("SpotBugs goal", "spotBugsGoal");

    return items;
}

Then, use an `<f:entry>` tag to enclose the normal select tag.

<f:entry field="goalType" title="Choose Goal Type">
   <f:select />
</f:entry>

Most form elements allow you to have inline help generated by adding a small HTML file and following some conventions.

For example the `<f:entry>` tag uses the `field` attribute.

Given a file in src/main/resources/myForm.jelly with this content:

<f:entry title="Name" field="name">
    <f:textbox />
</f:entry>

Adding a src/main/resources/help-name.html:

<div>
This is my content to help the end user understanding how to use this field.
</div>

Will automatically display the help button with the `<div>...</div>` content.

* Most controls support `help.html` as overall help for the `Describable`.

* The help message can be overridden in jelly with the `help` attribute, but please use the convention `help-fieldName.html` as much as possible.

* It is also possible to use localized help files, with the language specific suffix, so `help-fieldName.html` gets `help-fieldName_de.html` for the german version.

<f:entry title="This is a nice Title"  help="/plugin/my-plugin/help/custom-file.html">
